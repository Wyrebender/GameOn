<p>Due to the Valve controlling Steam, one of the largest computer gaming distributors in the world, Valve now have the authority to provide content delivery of the same game title towards Mac, PC, and Linux users.  Valve&lsquo;s main focus is to increase their branding across various computer gaming groups.  As a result, Valve will break the barrier of distributing exclusive titles to certain computer platforms.</p>

<p>Valve will be the gaming distribution company that will bridge the gap between Mac, PC, and Linux gamers.  Valve will also place computer title in the same level as gaming consoles.  Doing so should lower the cost of console game tiles and consider game publishers to go cross-platform without creating an extra step in using different game accounts.</p>

<p>In addition to expand the gaming community, Valve will also setup a tracker so computer game players can see others which operating system they are using.  Valve will also have a monitor available for computer players so they can check the status of what type of hardware other players are using.  This feature alone will cause the gaming community to expand like never before.  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam already has a large game community</a> with a total of over 26 million accounts.  Stem surpasses the largest console gaming network Xbox Live.  As of today, Xbox Live has a total of over 23 million users.</p>
